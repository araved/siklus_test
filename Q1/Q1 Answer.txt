Imagine you have a case, where you need to sort all of Indonesian people's height.
Their height may vary, between 20 cm (newborn) to 220 cm (maybe a very tall person).
Indonesia's population consists of more than 270 million people.
If you have the data of all Indonesia's resident heights, how do you want to sort this data? 

For example, for 5 people in the family, you have a list of their heights, 34, 160, 175, 90, 120. 
The sorted result should be 34, 90, 120, 160, 175. 
How will you do this for 270 million people?

Since we already know the amount of people (n) and also the upper and lower limit of the data,
we can use bin sort/bucket sort to get O(n). If we set the bin by the heights of the people, 
then it only need 1 iteration to go through the bins and the data would be sorted.

The algorithm can be found in the q1_test.py file
